# Wi-Fi-Intercom-in-Android
This project demonstrates the use of Multiple Client-Server Algorithm and VOIP communication over Wi-Fi P2P. It includes identification of devices using their IP addresses and keeping a track of the same on Firebase cloud along with their connection status in real time. This was developed for eliminating the use of PSTN and cellular network communication and switching to an optimized way of communicating within a confined space with the help of secured Wi-Fi P2P.
